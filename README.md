This ia fork of org.nyanya.android.traditionalt9
================================================

I have changed the package name to com.udifink.traditionalt9 so I could release independent versions on the Play store.
My fork's objections:
1. Supported and tested on Qin F21
2. Fully operated by the keypad
3. Hebrew support
4. Other changes not necessarily wanted by original author.

Original README:

Traditional T9 keypad IME for Android.

This is a Input Method Editor for Android that implements predictive text using the hardware keypad on the device. **Useless without a hardware numerical keypad.**
